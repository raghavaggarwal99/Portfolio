      using Cricbuzz app and their pain-points.

      <br>
      <br>
      
      So instead I carefully observed each screen, realized what's missing and what can be
      done to make user experience more intuitive.

      <br>
      <br>

      One thing that really needed to be redesign was app navigation. If I have to go
      from one screen to another, it was really difficult to manage them with one handed
      with thumb only. I love Samsung one UI and based on that I decided to restructure
      every screen of cricbuzz app also.

            The most challenging part of any project which I have observed is even starting it.
            Once I start it the next big thing is Deciding which problem to solve. As a UX designer, we are
            driven by curiosity and a burning desire to solve problems. The more insights we uncover,
            the more problems we will identify — and the harder it becomes to settle on just one. During research and design phase
            i got into loop of deciding what to give more time and which to not. If i have focused on all parts of Cricbuzz app, it would not have
            been possible to finish it all in 2 days at all. So focusing only on Important stuff is very crucial.
