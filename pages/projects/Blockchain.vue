      connect to. This means, every person who wants to interact with a dapp (Decentralized Application) will need a full copy of the blockchain 
      running on their computer/phone etc. That means, before you can use an application, you have to download the entire blockchain
       and then start using the application. This might sound ridiculous at first but it has the
        advantage of not relying on a single central server which might disappear tomorrow.

            Elevito happen during my college time. Its my greatest learning curve. I did everything that I can do all with love.
            It was time when We did not have even lots of projects to showcase on website, still we managed to show 15 Projects, out of which
            2 projects was fictional, I did them to learn more, and to be creative with them. I took really a lot of time like 2 months just
            showcasing 15 projects, there were times when It became very boring, couldn't give my best, but with everyone support and love
            I never lost enthusiasm and maintained our excitement. Whenever I couldn't do something, there were people whom i could lean on. This
            was all possible because each and everyone came together even in their busiest of time, even when exams were near.

        1 option is better than many.
        When you're communicating your process and solutions to a people who isn't always the key decision-maker,
        it's important to keep your points clear and concise enough for easy re-communication. Even though that person
        may appreciate the extra displayed effort, it can muddy the waters when feedback comes back out.
